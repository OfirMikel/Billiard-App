  - Tables can be marked as "occupied," "available," or "reserved."

- **Waiting List:**
  - Admins can see the current waiting list with user names and expected wait times.
  - Manage the waiting list by adding, removing, or adjusting user positions.

### Regular User Mode (R User):

- **Table Selection:**
  - Users can view the current status of all tables and select an available table for play.

- **Table Reservation:**
  - Users can reserve a specific table for a certain hour to guarantee a playing slot.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - The app's frontend is built using Java and XML, providing a native Android experience.
  - It ensures an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both admin and regular users.

- **Backend:**
  - The app's backend service is powered by Firebase, which handles user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
