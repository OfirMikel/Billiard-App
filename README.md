## Description

Welcome to the Billiard App, a comprehensive solution for managing and organizing the waiting list and table reservations at your billiard hall. This app offers two modes: Admin Mode and Regular User Mode. Admins can manage tables and waiting lists, while regular users can choose tables and reserve them for specific hours.

## Features

### Admin Mode:

- **Table Management:**
  - Admins can view and manage the availability and status of pool tables.
  - Tables can be marked as "occupied," "available," or "reserved."

- **Waiting List:**
  - Admins can see the current waiting list with user names and expected wait times.
  - Manage the waiting list by adding, removing, or adjusting user positions.

### Regular User Mode (R User):

- **Table Selection:**
  - Users can view the current status of all tables and select an available table for play.

- **Table Reservation:**
  - Users can reserve a specific table for a certain hour to guarantee a playing slot.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - The app's frontend is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - It ensures an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both admin and regular users.

- **Backend:**
  - The app's backend is powered by a server-side programming language (e.g., Python, Node.js) and a database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to manage data.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the frontend and backend environments according to the provided documentation.
3. Start the backend server.
4. Open the app in a web browser and log in using the appropriate credentials for admin or regular user mode.

## Future Enhancements

As the Billiard App evolves, we have planned several enhancements to further improve user experience and streamline management:

- **Real-time Updates:** Implementing real-time updates to reflect table availability changes and waiting list updates instantly.
- **User Profiles:** Allowing regular users to create profiles, track their reservations, and receive notifications.
- **Mobile App:** Developing a mobile version of the app to provide on-the-go access and better user engagement.
- **Integration with Payment:** Adding payment integration for table reservations to streamline the process.
- **Analytics:** Incorporating analytics features to provide insights into peak hours, popular tables, and user behavior.
